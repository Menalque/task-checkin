  To keep in sync with our goals let's use an org mode file shared on GitHub.  This doc is found in
  [[https://github.com/gitonthescene/task-checkin][this repository]].

** Wikidata Senators
  This is a project to upload all historical senator data from [[https://bioguideretro.congress.gov/][US government sources]] to [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_every_politician/United_States_of_America][Wikidata]].
  The data has been collected and uploaded to [[https://github.com/gitonthescene/wikidata/tree/master/every_politician/United_States_of_America/Senate][GitHub]].  Some processing was done using [[https://openrefine.org/documentation.html][OpenRefine]] and
  then subsequently uploaded to Wikidata with a basic schema.  (E.g. The [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q359442][Bernie Sanders]] has listings
  under [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q359442#Q359442$2E8E9668-A248-447D-A12D-EC8B8C34DF5C][position held]]).  The latest upload lists =position held= as [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4416090][United States senator]] and lists a
  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P2937][parliamentary term]].  Older style entries were not as comprehensive and are either missing
  parliamentary term or list =position held= with the more specific form [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q980774cl91][United States senator (116th
  Congress)]].  The goal is to consolidate all of these entries into a single form and ideally
  automate a process for keeping this information up-to-date.

*** Wikidata SPARQL queries
  You can search through Wikidata using a [[https://query.wikidata.org/][SPARQL query]].

  - Here are all the =position held= statements for Bernie Sanders:
    #+begin_src sql
    SELECT ?statement ?val ?unitLabel WHERE {
      wd:Q359442 p:P39 ?statement.
      ?statement ps:P39/wd:Q21514624* wd:Q4416090.
    }
    #+end_src

*** TODO Figure out what's missing from old upload to full upload.
